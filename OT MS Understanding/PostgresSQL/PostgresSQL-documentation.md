|      **Database**    | A collection of related data objects like tables, views, and functions.          |
|     **Schema**       | A logical grouping of database objects within a database.                        |
| **Table**     | A structured collection of data records with rows and columns.         |
| **Column**    | A named attribute of a table that holds specific data types like integers, text, or timestamps.       |
|   **Row**     | A single instance of data in a table, containing values for each column.      |
| **SQL (Structured Query Language)**    | A standardized language for querying and manipulating data in relational databases.  |
| **Indexes**    | Data structures that improve query performance by speeding up data retrieval.           |
| **Constraints**    | Rules that enforce data integrity by restricting the type or format of data allowed in a table.  |
