## Purpose

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for handling large datasets. It is designed for high availability, scalability, and robust performance, making it suitable for a wide range of applications from small to enterprise-level systems.

## Introduction

PostgreSQL is an advanced, object-relational database system known for its robustness, scalability, and compliance with SQL standards. It supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying, providing versatility for modern database applications. PostgreSQL is ACID-compliant and offers many advanced features such as MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control), data integrity, and transaction management.

## Features

| Feature                      | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ACID Compliance**           | Ensures database transactions are processed reliably (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). |
| **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)** | Allows multiple transactions to access the same data simultaneously without conflict. |
| **SQL & JSON Support**        | Supports both traditional SQL queries and modern JSON-based data types.    |
| **Extensibility**             | PostgreSQL supports custom data types, operators, and functions.            |
| **Replication**               | Supports synchronous and asynchronous replication for high availability.   |
| **Indexing**                  | Includes various indexing techniques (B-tree, GIN, GiST, etc.) for optimized query performance. |
| **Foreign Keys & Constraints**| Supports foreign keys, check constraints, unique constraints, and triggers.|
| **Partitioning**              | Allows large tables to be partitioned into smaller, more manageable pieces. |

## System Requirements

| Component                   | Minimum Requirement                           | Recommended Requirement                     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **CPU**                     | 1 GHz or higher                               | 2 GHz or higher                             |
| **RAM**                     | 2 GB                                          | 4 GB or more                                |
| **Disk Space**               | 2 GB (plus space for databases)               | 10 GB or more (depending on data size)     |
| **Operating System**         | Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.), macOS, Windows | Linux (preferred for performance)           |
| **PostgreSQL Version**       | 12.x or higher                               | Latest Stable Release (e.g., 15.x)         |
| **Database Connections**     | 10 concurrent connections                     | 100+ concurrent connections (depends on usage) |

## Important Ports

| Service                      | Port Number     | Description                                    |
|------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **PostgreSQL Database Server**| 5432            | Default port for database communication.       |
| **Replication**               | 5433 (default)  | Port used for replication between primary and standby nodes. |
| **pgAdmin**                   | 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS) | Web-based interface for managing PostgreSQL databases. |

## Architecture

PostgreSQL follows a client-server model, where the database server handles data storage, retrieval, and management, and clients send queries to the server for processing. The architecture includes multiple components, such as the database engine, query planner, executor, storage manager, and transaction manager.

- **Client Layer**: Application servers or end-user applications that interact with PostgreSQL through SQL.
- **Server Layer**: PostgreSQL engine processes SQL queries, manages transactions, and handles database storage.
- **Storage Layer**: The data is stored in tables and indexes in the file system, and PostgreSQL uses a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) to ensure data integrity.

## Advantages & Disadvantages

### Advantages

| Advantage                    | Description                                                                 |

| **Performance Overhead**      | Slightly slower compared to NoSQL databases for certain types of queries.   |
| **Concurrency**               | While MVCC is great for many cases, there may be overhead in highly concurrent environments. |
