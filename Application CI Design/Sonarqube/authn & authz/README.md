# Introduction
 SonarQube is a code quality analysis tool that can act as a security guard for your code by identifying bugs, vulnerabilities, and other issues. It makes sure only the right people can see and change your code.

# What is Authentication and Authorization
**Authentication** is proving who you are (like with a password).
\
**Authorization** is deciding what you can do (like access certain files or run specific programs).

# Why ?
SonarQube is a powerful tool for analyzing code quality and security. To protect the integrity of your codebase and ensure that only authorized individuals can access and modify critical information, it employs authentication and authorization mechanisms.

|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Security**            | Ensures only authorized users access SonarQube and protects the codebase from changes. |
| **Data Privacy**        | Keeps sensitive code secure by limiting access.    |
| **Role-Based Control**  | Assigns roles with specific permissions for tasks like analyzing code or reviewing reports. |
| **Auditing & Compliance** | Tracks user activity to meet security rules.          |

| **Authentication Method**       | **Description**                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Password-Based Authentication**| Users provide a username and password to authenticate.                                                                                                 |
| **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**| Combines something you know (password) with something you have (e.g., smartphone for a code) for added security.                                          |
| **Biometric Authentication**    | Uses physical characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or retinal scans to authenticate users.                                           |
| **Token-Based Authentication**  | Users log in once to receive a token (e.g., JWT), used for future requests without re-entering credentials.                                             |
| **Certificate-Based Authentication**| Uses a digital certificate (often with public/private key pairs) to authenticate users or devices.                                                       |
| **OAuth (Open Authorization)**   | A token-based standard that allows third-party apps to access a user's resources without exposing their password (used by Google, Facebook, etc.).      |
| **LDAP Authentication**         | Uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to authenticate users, common in enterprise environments with centralized user directories.          |
| **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)**| A protocol used for Single Sign-On (SSO), where an identity provider (IdP) authenticates the user and passes a token to the service provider.            |
| **Kerberos Authentication**     | A network authentication protocol that uses secret-key cryptography for strong authentication in client-server applications.                         |
| **Social Media Authentication** | Users authenticate using their social media accounts (e.g., Google, Facebook, LinkedIn) to access other services.                                       |
| **Smart Card Authentication**   | Uses a smart card with authentication data (often combined with a PIN) to authenticate a user.                                                         |

| **Authorization Method**           | **Description**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Internal Authentication**        | Uses SonarQube's built-in authentication system for user and role management.    |
| **LDAP/Active Directory**          | Integrates with LDAP or Active Directory for user authentication and synchronization. |
| **OAuth Authentication**           | Allows authentication via third-party services like Google, GitHub, or Bitbucket. |
| **SAML Authentication**            | Integrates with SAML for Single Sign-On (SSO), typically used in enterprise environments. |
| **Google Authenticator (2FA)**     | Supports two-factor authentication (2FA) using Google Authenticator for added security. |
| **Delegated Authentication**       | Allows delegating authentication to an external system or custom provider.     |
| **HTTP-Header Authentication**     | Authenticates users by passing credentials in HTTP headers, often used in API integrations. |
| **DevOps Integration (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.)** | Allows authentication via DevOps platforms like GitHub or Bitbucket for seamless integration with source control. |


# Conclusion

SonarQube is a powerful tool that combines authentication and authorization to safeguard your codebase. By implementing robust security measures, SonarQube ensures that only authorized individuals can access and modify your code, mitigating risks and protecting your intellectual property.
