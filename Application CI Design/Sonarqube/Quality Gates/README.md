## Introduction

SonarQube Quality Gates are a critical feature for enforcing code quality and ensuring the reliability, maintainability, and security of your projects. They act as checkpoints during the software development process, determining whether the code passes or fails based on predefined criteria.

---

## What Are Quality Gates?

Quality Gates are a set of conditions applied to a projectâ€™s code analysis results. If the project meets all the conditions, it "passes" the quality gate; otherwise, it "fails." These gates ensure that only high-quality code moves to production.

---

## Why Use Quality Gates?

Using Quality Gates in SonarQube provides the following benefits:

- **Early Detection**: Identifies code quality issues before they reach production.  
- **Automated Enforcement**: Enforces consistent quality standards across all projects.  
- **Improved Collaboration**: Promotes accountability among developers by clearly defining quality thresholds.  
- **Continuous Improvement**: Encourages teams to improve code quality over time.

## Key Metrics in Quality Gates

| **Metric**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Code Coverage**         | Percentage of code covered by automated tests. A key metric for test effectiveness. |
| **New Bugs**              | Number of bugs introduced in new or modified code.                              |
| **New Vulnerabilities**   | Tracks security issues in newly written code.                                   |
| **Code Smells**           | Measures maintainability issues in the codebase.                               |
| **Technical Debt**        | Estimated effort required to fix code issues.                                   |
| **Duplicated Code**       | Percentage of duplicated lines in the codebase.                                 |
| **Reliability Rating**    | Assesses the robustness of the code (A to E scale).                             |
| **Security Rating**       | Measures the resilience to security threats (A to E scale).                     |
| **Maintainability Rating**| Evaluates the ease of maintaining the codebase (A to E scale).                  |

## Default Quality Gate in SonarQube

SonarQube comes with a built-in **"Sonar way"** Quality Gate, which includes the following conditions:

1. **New Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage for new code.  
2. **No New Bugs**: Zero bugs introduced in new code.  
3. **No New Vulnerabilities**: Zero vulnerabilities in new code.  
4. **No New Code Smells**: Maintainability thresholds for new code.  
5. **Technical Debt Ratio**: Remain within acceptable levels.

---

## Customizing Quality Gates

SonarQube allows you to create custom Quality Gates tailored to your project's requirements.

### Steps to Customize:
1. Navigate to **Administration > Quality Gates** in the SonarQube interface.  
2. Click **Create** to add a new Quality Gate.  
3. Add conditions by specifying metrics and thresholds.  
4. Assign the Quality Gate to your project(s).  

### Example:
- **Condition**: New Code Coverage >= 90%  
- **Condition**: New Bugs <= 0  
- **Condition**: Duplicated Code <= 3%

## Best Practices for Quality Gates

| **Best Practice**                     | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus on New Code**                 | Prioritize monitoring and improving the quality of new code to maintain overall project health. |
| **Set Realistic Thresholds**          | Ensure thresholds are achievable but promote improvement.                      |
| **Align with Team Goals**             | Customize gates to reflect your team's quality standards and goals.            |
| **Integrate with CI/CD**              | Enforce Quality Gates in Continuous Integration/Delivery pipelines.            |
| **Regularly Review Gates**            | Update Quality Gates periodically to align with evolving project needs.        |

## Conclusion

SonarQube Quality Gates are an essential mechanism for maintaining high standards in software development. By leveraging built-in and customized Quality Gates, teams can proactively enforce quality and foster continuous improvement.
