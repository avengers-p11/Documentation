## Introduction

SonarQube generates several log files to provide insights into system performance, errors, and activities. These logs are essential for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing the SonarQube server.

This document identifies all major log files generated by SonarQube and describes their purpose.

## Overview of SonarQube Log Files

SonarQube produces log files in its installation directory, typically under the `logs/` folder. Each log file captures specific types of information about SonarQube's operation, including startup processes, background tasks, web server activities, and search engine behavior.

## Types of Logs

| **Log File**             | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`sonar.log`**           | Main log file that captures general information about the SonarQube server startup and configuration. |
| **`web.log`**             | Logs related to the web server activities, such as HTTP requests, user authentication, and API calls. |
| **`ce.log`** (Compute Engine) | Tracks background task execution, including code analysis and report generation.                 |
| **`es.log`** (Elasticsearch) | Logs Elasticsearch operations, such as indexing, which supports search functionality in SonarQube. |
| **`access.log`**          | Records HTTP access logs for incoming requests to the SonarQube server.                            |

## Log File Descriptions

### 1. **`sonar.log`**  
- **Purpose**: Provides information about the overall system status, including server startup and configuration details.  
- **Example Contents**:  
  - System environment variables.  
  - Warnings or errors during initialization.  
  - Plugin loading status.  

---

### 2. **`web.log`**  
- **Purpose**: Tracks activities related to the SonarQube web application.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Troubleshooting user authentication issues.  
  - Monitoring API usage and HTTP requests.  

---

### 3. **`ce.log`**  
- **Purpose**: Logs background tasks performed by the Compute Engine, such as code analysis and report generation.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Debugging issues with project analysis.  
  - Tracking long-running tasks.  

---

### 4. **`es.log`**  
- **Purpose**: Monitors Elasticsearch operations that support search functionality in SonarQube.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Troubleshooting indexing issues.  
  - Debugging problems with search queries.  

---

### 5. **`access.log`**  
- **Purpose**: Provides detailed records of HTTP requests to the SonarQube server.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Analyzing user activity.  
  - Monitoring API access patterns.  
  - Identifying potential unauthorized access attempts.  

---

## Best Practices for Log Management

1. **Log Retention**:  
   - Configure log retention policies to avoid excessive disk usage.  
   - Archive old logs for compliance or auditing purposes.  

2. **Log Rotation**:  
   - Use log rotation tools (e.g., `logrotate`) to manage log file sizes.  

3. **Centralized Logging**:  
   - Integrate with centralized logging tools like ELK Stack, Splunk, or Fluentd for better analysis.  

4. **Monitoring and Alerts**:  
   - Set up alerts for critical errors or warnings detected in the logs.  

5. **Security**:  
   - Ensure logs do not contain sensitive information like passwords or tokens.  
   - Restrict access to log files to authorized personnel.

## Conclusion

SonarQube's log files are invaluable resources for understanding the server's health, identifying issues, and monitoring activities. By properly managing these logs, you can ensure that your SonarQube instance remains secure and performant.
