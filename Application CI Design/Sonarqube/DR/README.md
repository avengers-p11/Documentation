## Introduction

SonarQube DR focuses on minimizing downtime and data loss through regular backups, efficient recovery procedures, and optimized recovery times. By implementing a strong DR strategy, organizations can protect critical analysis data and maintain seamless development workflows, even in the face of disruptions. This document outlines the key components of disaster recovery for SonarQube, focusing on **Backup**, **Recovery**, and **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**.

# Backup Strategy

## 1. Identify Critical Components to Back Up

### Database
The SonarQube database stores all critical data, including:
- Project analysis results
- Configuration settings
- User information

Backing up the database is essential for disaster recovery. Supported databases include:
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Oracle
- Microsoft SQL Server

---

### Configuration Files
- **`sonar.properties`:** Contains essential system configuration settings.
- **`wrapper.conf`:** Manages JVM settings for SonarQube.

---

### Plugins Directory
- Stores all installed plugins that extend SonarQube's functionality.

---

## 2. Choose a Backup Method

### Database Backups
Use database-specific tools to back up the database. Examples include:
- **PostgreSQL:** `pg_dump` or `pg_basebackup`
- **MySQL:** `mysqldump`
- **Oracle:** `Data Pump Export`
- **SQL Server:** Backup commands or SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

---

### File Backups
Use tools like:
- `rsync`  
- `tar`  
- Backup software (e.g., **Veeam**, **Bacula**)  

These tools can back up configuration files and plugins.

---

## 3. Automate Backup Processes
Create scripts or use automation tools to schedule regular backups for both the database and the file system.

## 4. Use Secure and reduntant Storage
Cloud Storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.)
On-premises storage with RAID configurations.
Offsite storage for disaster recovery.

## 5. Backup Schedule

- **Daily:**  
  Perform database backups to capture frequent changes and ensure data consistency.

- **Weekly:**  
  Back up configuration files and plugins to account for updates and changes in the system setup.

- **Monthly:**  
  Conduct a full system backup for comprehensive disaster recovery, including all critical components.

---                                                    

### Recommended Backup Practices:
- **Frequency**: Perform backups daily or before any major changes.  
- **Automation**: Use scripts or tools to automate the backup process.  
- **Storage**: Store backups in multiple secure locations (on-site and off-site).  
- **Testing**: Periodically test backups to ensure they are functional and up-to-date.

# Recovery Process

The recovery process for SonarQube involves restoring its critical components—database, configuration files, and plugins—to ensure a smooth and efficient return to operational state after a failure or disaster. Below is a step-by-step guide to the recovery process:

---

## 1. Prepare the Environment
- Ensure the target environment is ready:
  - Install the same version of SonarQube as the backed-up instance.
  - Install any required dependencies (e.g., Java, database client tools).
  - Configure the network and storage to match the original setup.

---

## 2. Restore the Database
- Use the database backup to restore the SonarQube database:
  - **PostgreSQL:**  
    ```bash
    pg_restore -U sonar_user -d sonar_db /path/to/backup/sonar_db_backup.dump
    ```
  - **MySQL:**  
    ```bash
    mysql -u sonar_user -p sonar_db < /path/to/backup/sonar_db_backup.sql
    ```
  - **Oracle:**  
    Use Oracle Data Pump Import utility.
  - **SQL Server:**  
    Restore the database using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or equivalent commands.

---

## 3. Restore Configuration Files
- Replace the default configuration files with the backed-up files:
  - `sonar.properties`: Copy and replace this file in the `conf` directory of your SonarQube installation.
  - `wrapper.conf`: Restore JVM settings by replacing this file in the `conf` directory.

---

## 4. Restore Plugins
- Copy the backed-up plugins directory to the `extensions/plugins` folder of the new SonarQube instance.

---

## 5. Start the SonarQube Server
- Start the SonarQube server using the appropriate commands:
  ```bash
  ./bin/<OS>/sonar.sh start
  ```
## 6. Validate the Recovery

- Access the SonarQube instance via the browser at:  
  `http://<server>:9000`

- Verify the following:  
  - All projects and analysis results are restored.  
  - Configurations, rules, and quality profiles are intact.  
  - Plugins are functional and properly loaded.  

---

## 7. Post-Recovery Steps

- Notify stakeholders of the restored service.  
- Conduct a test analysis on a project to ensure full functionality.  
- Update the recovery documentation with any observations or changes during the process.  


### Key Recovery Tips:
- Maintain documentation for recovery procedures.  
- Have dedicated personnel trained for disaster recovery operations.  
- Ensure that system and network dependencies (e.g., databases, storage, and connectivity) are functional before recovery.  
---

## Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)

**MTTR** is a critical metric in disaster recovery, representing the average time required to restore SonarQube to full functionality after a failure.

### Factors Affecting MTTR:
- **Backup Accessibility**: The speed of accessing and retrieving backups.  
- **Recovery Automation**: Automated recovery scripts reduce manual effort and recovery time.  
- **Testing and Preparation**: Regular recovery drills reduce response time in real disasters.  
- **System Complexity**: The size of the database, number of extensions, and network configuration can impact recovery time.  

### Reducing MTTR:
- Implement continuous monitoring to detect failures early.  
- Automate backup and recovery tasks where possible.  
- Maintain a secondary SonarQube instance in a hot or warm standby configuration for critical systems.  

---

## Conclusion

With a robust disaster recovery strategy, automated backups, and minimized downtime through reduced MTTR, SonarQube can be a reliable cornerstone of any DevOps ecosystem. Its scalability and flexibility make it suitable for projects of all sizes, ensuring that your codebase remains secure, maintainable, and aligned with business goals. Adopting SonarQube is not just an investment in quality; it's a commitment to delivering better, more reliable software to your users.
