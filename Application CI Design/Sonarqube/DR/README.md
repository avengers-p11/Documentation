## Introduction

SonarQube is a widely-used platform for continuous code quality inspection and analysis. In any mission-critical system, implementing a robust disaster recovery strategy is essential to minimize downtime and prevent data loss. This document outlines the key components of disaster recovery for SonarQube, focusing on **Backup**, **Recovery**, and **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**.

## Backup Strategy

Creating regular backups is a crucial part of disaster recovery. The backup strategy for SonarQube involves:

| **Component**          | **Backup Description**                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Database**            | Backup the database containing all SonarQube data (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle).                   |
| **Configuration Files** | Save configuration files such as `sonar.properties` and `wrapper.conf`.                                   |
| **Extensions Directory**| Backup plugins and custom rules located in the `extensions` directory.                                     |
| **Logs (Optional)**     | Retain logs for debugging and auditing purposes.                                                           |

### Recommended Backup Practices:
- **Frequency**: Perform backups daily or before any major changes.  
- **Automation**: Use scripts or tools to automate the backup process.  
- **Storage**: Store backups in multiple secure locations (on-site and off-site).  
- **Testing**: Periodically test backups to ensure they are functional and up-to-date.

## Recovery Process

When a disaster occurs, recovery involves restoring SonarQube to its operational state using the most recent backups. The steps are:

| **Step**              | **Description**                                                                                              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stop SonarQube**     | Shut down the SonarQube instance to prevent further changes.                                                |
| **Restore Database**   | Restore the database backup using the backup tool specific to the database (e.g., `pg_restore` for PostgreSQL). |
| **Restore Configurations** | Replace the corrupted configuration files with the backup copies.                                         |
| **Restore Extensions** | Replace the `extensions` directory with the backup copy to restore plugins and custom rules.                |
| **Verify Integrity**   | Check logs and perform a quick scan to verify the systemâ€™s integrity and functionality.                     |
| **Restart SonarQube**  | Restart the SonarQube service and ensure all components are operational.                                    |

### Key Recovery Tips:
- Maintain documentation for recovery procedures.  
- Have dedicated personnel trained for disaster recovery operations.  
- Ensure that system and network dependencies (e.g., databases, storage, and connectivity) are functional before recovery.

## Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)

**MTTR** is a critical metric in disaster recovery, representing the average time required to restore SonarQube to full functionality after a failure.

### Factors Affecting MTTR:
- **Backup Accessibility**: The speed of accessing and retrieving backups.  
- **Recovery Automation**: Automated recovery scripts reduce manual effort and recovery time.  
- **Testing and Preparation**: Regular recovery drills reduce response time in real disasters.  
- **System Complexity**: The size of the database, number of extensions, and network configuration can impact recovery time.  

### Reducing MTTR:
- Implement continuous monitoring to detect failures early.  
- Automate backup and recovery tasks where possible.  
- Maintain a secondary SonarQube instance in a hot or warm standby configuration for critical systems.

## Conclusion

A robust disaster recovery plan ensures that SonarQube remains a reliable component of your development pipeline, minimizing downtime and safeguarding critical data. Regularly review and refine your **Backup**, **Recovery**, and **MTTR** strategies to align with evolving business needs.
