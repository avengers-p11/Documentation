# Introduction
SonarQube is a powerful tool designed to continuously inspect your code quality and security. It performs automatic reviews through static code analysis, identifying bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells in various programming languages.

# What 
SonarQube (formerly known as Sonar) is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuously checking the quality of code. It automatically reviews code by performing static analysis to detect bugs, code smells (issues that may not be bugs but could make the code harder to maintain), and other potential problems. SonarQube supports 29 programming languages.


# Why ?
SonarQube as a quality control inspector for your code. It helps you write better, more reliable, and more secure software.
