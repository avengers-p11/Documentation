# Challenges Before and After Jenkins

| **Challenges Before Jenkins**                          | **How Jenkins Resolves Them**                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Manual code integration** leading to frequent errors.    | **Automates code integration** with CI pipelines.                          |
| **Delayed feedback** on build and test results.            | Provides **real-time feedback** on builds and tests.                       |
| **Time-consuming deployments** with manual processes.      | **Automates deployment** with CD pipelines.                                |
| **Lack of standardization** in build and release processes.| **Ensures consistency** with defined pipelines and scripts.                |
| Difficulty in **integrating with multiple tools**.         | **Offers a large plugin** ecosystem for seamless tool integrations.        |
| **Scalability issues** for distributed builds.             | Supports **master-agent architecture** for distributed builds.             |
| **Lack of visibility** into build and deployment status.   | **Provides dashboards and logs** for monitoring and troubleshooting.       |

**This image represents the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. Developers commit code to a Git repository, triggering Jenkins to run automated tasks like build, test, stage, and deploy. Jenkins orchestrates these steps in a continuous integration and delivery process, ensuring the code is properly tested and deployed to production.**

## Features of Jenkins
