## Why We Are Not Using GitLab in Our OT Microservice

| **Reason**                        | **Description**                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Existing Tool Preferences**     | We are already using GitHub for version control and CI/CD, so migrating to GitLab may not provide significant added value at this stage.         |
| **Limited Expertise**             | Our team is more familiar with GitHub and other tools, and adopting GitLab would require additional training, causing a potential productivity delay. |
| **Cost Concerns**                 | GitLab offers a free version, but to unlock advanced features, we would need a paid subscription, which might not align with our budget.          |
| **Feature Overlap**               | The existing tools we use already provide the features GitLab would offer, leading to redundancy and no immediate need for GitLab.                  |
| **Infrastructure Constraints**    | If we were to self-host GitLab, it would require additional infrastructure and maintenance, which isn't feasible for our current environment.      |


## Conclusion  

GitHub is the preferred platform for our OT Microservices project due to its ease of use, cost-effectiveness, and seamless integration with our existing workflows. While GitLab offers similar features, GitHub meets our needs for version control, CI/CD, and project management without requiring additional migration or resources. The overlap in features and our team's familiarity with GitHub make it the best choice for our project.
