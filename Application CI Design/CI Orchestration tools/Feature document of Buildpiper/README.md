## Why BuildPiper
If we are using Kubernetes in our project, BuildPiper becomes an excellent choice due to its deep integration with Kubernetes. It streamlines microservices deployment, automates CI/CD workflows, and simplifies cluster management. With built-in monitoring, security, and pre-configured pipelines, BuildPiper reduces the complexity of Kubernetes operations, making it ideal for our small team to manage microservices efficiently.

## Conclusion

BuildPiper is a powerful CI/CD platform, but it is unsuitable for our team's current setup and expertise. We use Jenkins for our CI/CD workflows, which efficiently meets our needs. Adopting BuildPiper would introduce unnecessary complexity and additional costs, so we prefer to continue using Jenkins.
