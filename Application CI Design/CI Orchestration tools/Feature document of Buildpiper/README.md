## Why We Are Not Using BuildPiper in Our OT Microservice

We decided not to use BuildPiper in our OT Microservices project for the following reasons:

| **Reason**                            | **Description**                                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Existing Tool Preference**          | We are already using GitHub for version control and CI/CD, which provides sufficient features for our needs.         |
| **Familiarity and Expertise**         | Our team has existing expertise with GitHub Actions, and switching to BuildPiper would require significant retraining. |
| **Infrastructure Constraints**        | BuildPiper requires self-hosting, which would add additional infrastructure maintenance costs and effort.              |
| **Cost and Resource Overhead**        | While BuildPiper is open-source, it would require additional resources to host and scale, which is not ideal for our current setup. |
| **Feature Overlap**                   | GitHub Actions already provides the necessary CI/CD capabilities without the complexity of managing an additional tool. |

---

## Conclusion

While BuildPiper offers a powerful set of features for CI/CD automation, including multi-cloud integration, scalable pipelines, and containerized builds, it does not align with the current infrastructure and expertise of our team. Given that we are already using GitHub for version control and CI/CD workflows, adopting BuildPiper would introduce unnecessary complexity, resource overhead, and a steep learning curve. Therefore, GitHub Actions remains the most suitable choice for our OT Microservices project.
