# Introduction
Unit testing is like checking each piece to make sure it fits correctly and works as it should. By testing each piece individually, we can catch any mistakes early on and build a stronger, more stable castle. fixing errors in small parts of our code, so the whole program works correctly.

# What is Unit Testing

Unit testing is a way to test small pieces of code to make sure they work correctly. It's like testing each brick in a wall to make sure it's strong and fits properly.

# Why

| **Reasons**               | **Description**                                                                                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Early Bug Detection**    | It helps find and fix errors early in the development process, before they become bigger problems.    |
| **Improved Code Quality**  | It encourages writing clean, well-structured, and maintainable code.                                 |
| **Increased Confidence**   | By testing small parts of your code, you can be more confident that your software will work as expected. |
| **Facilitates Refactoring**| It allows you to make changes to your code without fear of breaking things, as unit tests can quickly identify any unintended consequences. |
| **Documentation**          | Unit tests serve as living documentation, showing how code is intended to be used.                   |


# Different Tools
Static analysis tools are important for checking the quality of code. These tools look at the code without running it, helping to find problems like simple mistakes or more complex design issues. Here's a look at some popular static analysis tools used in Java.



# Conclusion

The goal of unit testing is to make sure that any new functionality does not break the existing functionality. It also helps identify any issues or bugs earlier in the development process and helps ensure that code meets quality standards set by the organisation.
