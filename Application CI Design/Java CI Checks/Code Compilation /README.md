# Introduction

Code Compilation is like Translation. it's the process of converting human-readable code into machine-readable code. A software program called a compiler performs this translation

# What

A compiler is a special software program that acts like a translator. It takes your code, written in a human-readable language like Python or Java, and translates it into machine language. This process is called compilation.


# Why

Code compilation is necessary because computers can only understand machine code. Code compilation in Java is the bridge between human-readable code and machine-executable instructions, enabling Java programs to run seamlessly on various platforms.

| **Reason**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Translation**   | Converts human-readable code into machine-readable instructions for execution.  |
| **Execution**     | Compiled languages run faster because they are translated into machine code before execution. |
| **Debugging**     | Errors are caught during compilation, making debugging easier and more effective. |


# Java compilation process

Java Compiler (javac) generates Bytecode

| **Step**               | **Description**                                                                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Generating Bytecode** | `javac` compiles source code to platform-independent bytecode in `.class` files via parsing, analysis, and optimization. |
| **Verifying Bytecode**  | JVM verifies bytecode for type safety, security, and correctness before execution.                   |
| **Execution**           | JVM uses the Class Loader to load classes and the Execution Engine to interpret or JIT compile bytecode. |

# Different Tools

| **Tool**            | **Description**                                                                 | **Advantages**                                                                 | **Why**                                                                                                                                           |
