## Introduction
 License scanning analyzes and identifies software licenses associated with code or components in a project.

---

## Why License Scanning?
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensures compliance with license terms and conditions.
- **OSS Management**: Identifies and manages licenses in open-source components.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies legal risks associated with specific licenses.
- **Intellectual Property Protection**: Ensures compliance with license terms.
- **Security and Quality Assurance**: Evaluates security, quality, and reputation of components.
