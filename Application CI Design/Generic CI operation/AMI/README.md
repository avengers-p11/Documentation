## What is a CI Operation AMI?

A **CI Operation AMI** is an Amazon Machine Image specifically tailored for CI workflows. It provides:
- Pre-installed CI tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab Runner).
- Pre-configured environments for building, testing, and deploying applications.
- Support for automation scripts and configuration management.

The goal is to minimize setup overhead and ensure consistency across CI environments.

## Why Use a CI Operation AMI?

Using a CI Operation AMI offers several benefits:
1. **Consistency:** Ensures identical environments across all CI pipelines.
2. **Reduced Setup Time:** Eliminates the need to configure tools from scratch.
3. **Scalability:** Easily deploy AMI instances across multiple environments.
4. **Security:** Built-in security patches and hardened configurations.
5. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Optimized for on-demand scaling, reducing idle resource costs.
