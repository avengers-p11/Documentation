## Introduction
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) for GoLang applications, including its definition, tools, best practices, and a Proof of Concept (POC). DAST analyzes running applications to identify vulnerabilities and ensure robust security.

## What is DAST?
DAST is a black-box testing approach that simulates external threats by analyzing an application's runtime behavior. Unlike SAST, which examines source code, DAST interacts with the application to detect vulnerabilities without requiring access to its codebase.

## Why DAST?
GoLang is widely used for developing high-performance, secure applications. However, runtime issues such as misconfigurations and improper input validation can compromise security. DAST is crucial for GoLang applications to:

- **Identify Runtime Vulnerabilities:** Detect flaws in live environments.
- **Enhance Security Posture:** Provide real-time security assessments.
- **Complement Code Analysis:** Uncover vulnerabilities missed by static analysis tools.

## Different DAST Tools for Java
Several DAST tools are available that cater to GoLang applications. Some of the prominent ones include:
|Tool|Description|
|------|---------|
|OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)| A free and open-source tool widely used for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It supports automation and integration with CI/CD pipelines.|
|Burp Suite| A popular tool among security professionals, offering both free and paid versions. It provides extensive features for web vulnerability scanning and is highly customizable.|
|Acunetix| A commercial web vulnerability scanner known for its comprehensive coverage and ease of use. It offers deep scanning capabilities and integrates well with various development environments.|
|Netsparker| Another commercial tool that provides automated security testing for web applications. It is known for its accuracy in identifying vulnerabilities.|
|AppSpider| A tool by Rapid7 that offers dynamic analysis and integrates with various DevOps tools to provide continuous security testing.|

## Comparison of DAST Tools

|Tool|	Free/Paid	|Ease of Use|	Integration|	Customizability|	Accuracy|
|---|----|------|-----|-----|------|
|OWASP ZAP|	Free|	Moderate|	High|	High|	High|
|Burp Suite	|Free/Paid	|Moderate	|High	|High|	High|
|Acunetix|	Paid|	High|	High|	Moderate|	Very High|
|Netsparker	|Paid	|High	|High	|Moderate	|Very High|
|AppSpider	|Paid	|High	|High	|High	|High|

## Advantages of DAST
|Advantages|Description|
|------|--------------|
|Real-Time Testing| DAST identifies vulnerabilities during the actual running state of the application.|
|Broad Coverage|It can detect a wide range of vulnerabilities, including configuration issues and runtime problems.|
|No Source Code Required| Since DAST is a black-box testing method, it does not require access to the source code, making it suitable for testing third-party applications.|
|Compliance|Helps in meeting various regulatory requirements by ensuring the application is secure from common vulnerabilities.|

## Best Practices 

**Integrate Early and Often**: Integrate DAST into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous security testing throughout the development lifecycle.

**Complement with SAST**: Use DAST in conjunction with SAST to cover both static code vulnerabilities and runtime issues.

**Regular Updates**: Keep the DAST tools updated to ensure they can detect the latest vulnerabilities and threats.

**Automate Scans**: Automate regular scans to catch vulnerabilities as soon as they are introduced.

## POC

For detailed insights into how to perform DAST for GoLang application, you can view our Proof of Concept (POC) document. Click [here](https://github.com/avengers-p11/Documentation/blob/main/Application%20CI%20Design/Golang%20CI%20Checks/DAST/POC.md)


## Conclusion
DAST is essential for identifying vulnerabilities in GoLang applications during runtime. By using tools like **OWASP ZAP**, developers can ensure their applications are secure, compliant, and resilient against modern threats. Integrating DAST into your security pipeline strengthens your applicationâ€™s security posture and minimizes risks.
