## Introduction
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) for GoLang applications, including its definition, tools, best practices, and a Proof of Concept (POC). DAST analyzes running applications to identify vulnerabilities and ensure robust security.

## Why DAST?

| **Purpose**                   | **Explanation**                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Identify Runtime Vulnerabilities** | Detect flaws in live environments that may not be visible during development or static analysis. |
| **Enhance Security Posture**   | Provide real-time security assessments to identify potential risks and improve the security stance of the application. |
| **Complement Code Analysis**  | Uncover vulnerabilities that static analysis tools may miss by testing the application in its runtime environment. |


## Different DAST Tools for Golang
Several DAST tools are available that cater to GoLang applications. Some of the prominent ones include:

|Tool|Description|
|------|---------|
|**OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**| A free and open-source tool widely used for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It supports automation and integration with CI/CD pipelines.|
|**Burp Suite**| A popular tool among security professionals, offering both free and paid versions. It provides extensive features for web vulnerability scanning and is highly customizable.|
|**Acunetix**| A commercial web vulnerability scanner known for its comprehensive coverage and ease of use. It offers deep scanning capabilities and integrates well with various development environments.|
|**Netsparker**| Another commercial tool that provides automated security testing for web applications. It is known for its accuracy in identifying vulnerabilities.|
|**AppSpider**| A tool by Rapid7 that offers dynamic analysis and integrates with various DevOps tools to provide continuous security testing.|

## Comparison of DAST Tools

|Tool|	Free/Paid	|Ease of Use|	Integration|	Customizability|	Accuracy|
|---|----|------|-----|-----|------|
|**OWASP ZAP**|	Free|	Moderate|	High|	High|	High|
|**Burp Suite**	|Free/Paid	|Moderate	|High	|High|	High|
|**Acunetix**|	Paid|	High|	High|	Moderate|	Very High|
|**Netsparker**	|Paid	|High	|High	|Moderate	|Very High|
|**AppSpider**	|Paid	|High	|High	|High	|High|

## Advantages of DAST

|Advantages|Description|
|------|--------------|
|**Real-Time Testing**| DAST identifies vulnerabilities during the actual running state of the application.|
|**Broad Coverage**|It can detect a wide range of vulnerabilities, including configuration issues and runtime problems.|
|**No Source Code Required**| Since DAST is a black-box testing method, it does not require access to the source code, making it suitable for testing third-party applications.|
|**Compliance**|Helps in meeting various regulatory requirements by ensuring the application is secure from common vulnerabilities.|

## Disadvantages of DAST

| **Disadvantage**               | **Explanation**                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Limited Coverage**           | DAST primarily focuses on the application's runtime behavior and may miss vulnerabilities in the underlying code or architecture. |
| **False Positives**            | DAST tools can sometimes flag false positives, reporting issues that are not actual vulnerabilities, leading to unnecessary remediation efforts. |
| **Time-Consuming**             | DAST typically requires a fully deployed application to scan, which can make testing slower compared to static analysis methods. |
| **Requires Running Application** | Since DAST requires the application to be up and running, it cannot be used for static code or environments without a live instance. |

## Best Practices

| **Best Practice**                     | **Description**                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Integrate Early and Often**         | Integrate DAST into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous security testing throughout the development lifecycle. |
| **Complement with SAST**              | Use DAST in conjunction with SAST to cover both static code vulnerabilities and runtime issues.          |
| **Regular Updates**                   | Keep the DAST tools updated to ensure they can detect the latest vulnerabilities and threats.            |
| **Automate Scans**                    | Automate regular scans to catch vulnerabilities as soon as they are introduced.                          |

## POC

For detailed insights into how to perform DAST for GoLang application, you can view our Proof of Concept (POC) document. Click [here](https://github.com/avengers-p11/Documentation/blob/main/Application%20CI%20Design/Golang%20CI%20Checks/DAST/POC.md)


## Conclusion
DAST is essential for identifying vulnerabilities in GoLang applications during runtime. By using tools like **OWASP ZAP**, developers can ensure their applications are secure, compliant, and resilient against modern threats. Integrating DAST into your security pipeline strengthens your applicationâ€™s security posture and minimizes risks.
