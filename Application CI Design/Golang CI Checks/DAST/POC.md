## Introduction
This POC demonstrates the use of Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to identify security vulnerabilities in GoLang-based applications. Using OWASP ZAP, we analyze the applicationâ€™s resilience against potential security threats by simulating attacks.

## Pre-requisites
- [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) 
- A running GoLang application to perform DAST.

# Step-by-Step Setup Guide

**Step 1**: Update Your Linux System

Before installing OWASP ZAP, it's essential to update your system to ensure that you have the latest packages and security patches. To update your system, open the terminal and type the following command:
```
sudo apt update
```
**Step 2**: Install OWASP ZAP

Once your system is up to date, you can install OWASP ZAP. To do so, type the following command in the terminal:
```
sudo snap install zaproxy --classic
````
**Step 3**: Launch OWASP ZAP

Once the installation is complete, you can launch OWASP ZAP from the application menu or the command line. To launch it from the command line, type the following command:
```
zaproxy
```

**Step 5** : Analyze Results

 After the scan, navigate to the Alerts tab to see the list of identified vulnerabilities. Click on each **alert** to see details .

## Conclusion

DAST using OWASP ZAP for GoLang applications effectively uncovers security vulnerabilities by simulating real-world threats. By incorporating DAST into your CI/CD pipelines, you ensure your applications remain secure and resilient against evolving attack vectors.
