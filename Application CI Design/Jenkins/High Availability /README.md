## Introduction

High Availability (HA) in Jenkins ensures that your CI/CD pipelines remain operational even in the face of hardware or software failures. This is crucial for organizations that rely on Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous delivery, as it minimizes downtime and maintains productivity.
There are two ways you can have Jenkins in HA mode-

- Jenkins active/passive setup
- Jenkins HA setup in autoscaling Group

In this docs, we will discuss the HA setup using autoscaling.

## Why Jenkins High Availability?

| **Reason**               | **Description**                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Business Continuity**   | Ensure uninterrupted Jenkins services.                                                          |
| **Minimize Downtime**     | Prevent system failures from affecting CI/CD pipelines.                                         |
| **Scalability**           | Scale Jenkins to meet growing demands by distributing workloads.                                |
| **Redundancy**            | Duplicate Jenkins instances to avoid service disruptions.                                        |
| **Load Balancing**        | Distribute incoming traffic across multiple Jenkins instances to improve performance and resilience. |

## Architecture Overview

| **Component**            | **Description**                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Jenkins Master**        | Responsible for managing jobs, configurations, and the overall Jenkins environment. Multiple Jenkins masters behind a load balancer ensure high availability. |
| **Jenkins Agents (Slaves)** | Distribute the workload. In HA setups, agents are spread across multiple machines (physical, virtual, or containerized). |
| **Shared Storage**        | Jenkins stores configurations, jobs, logs, and artifacts in a shared file system accessible by all nodes. |
| **Database Replication**  | Configure Jenkins to store job histories, configurations, and logs in a replicated database system to prevent data loss. |
| **Load Balancer**         | Sits in front of the Jenkins masters to distribute incoming traffic. Automatically redirects traffic to a healthy master in case of failure. |

## High Availability Setup Steps

### Step 1: Setting Up Multiple Jenkins Masters

1. **Install Jenkins on Multiple Machines**: Install Jenkins on at least two machines (or virtual instances). These will act as your Jenkins masters.
2. **Configure Jenkins Masters**: Ensure that both Jenkins masters are configured identically. They should share the same job configurations and plugin settings.
3. **Database Configuration**: Point the Jenkins masters to the same shared database for storing jobs, configurations, and user data.
4. **Configure Load Balancer**: Set up a load balancer (e.g., HAProxy, Nginx) to distribute traffic between the Jenkins masters. If one master fails, the load balancer should route traffic to the remaining active master.

### Step 2: Configuring Jenkins Agents

1. **Set Up Jenkins Agents**: Install and configure Jenkins agents (slaves) on different machines or containers.
2. **Connect Agents to Masters**: Ensure that Jenkins agents are registered with all masters to enable job execution from any master.
3. **Distributed Load**: Use the load balancer to evenly distribute the job load across the agents.

### Step 3: Shared File System Setup

1. **Install NFS/Cloud Storage**: Set up a shared file system using NFS or cloud-based storage solutions (AWS EFS, Google Cloud Storage).
2. **Mount the Shared Storage**: Mount the shared storage on all Jenkins masters and agents to ensure access to the same data.

### Step 4: Backups and Disaster Recovery

1. **Backup Configurations and Data**: Use plugins (e.g., ThinBackup Plugin) to automate the backup of Jenkins data (configurations, jobs, artifacts).
2. **Ensure Consistency**: Schedule regular backups of the shared file system and Jenkins database.

### Step 5: Testing and Validation

1. **Failover Testing**: Perform regular failover tests by manually stopping one Jenkins master to ensure that the load balancer redirects traffic to another master.
2. **Job Execution Validation**: Ensure that jobs are picked up by agents, even if the Jenkins master fails.

## Benefits of Jenkins High Availability

| **Benefit**                    | **Description**                                                         |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Minimized Downtime**          | Reduces service disruptions during failures by quickly redirecting traffic. |
| **Load Distribution**           | Balances the load across multiple Jenkins instances, improving performance. |
| **Scalability**                 | Easily scale Jenkins to meet growing demands with additional masters and agents. |
| **Resilience**                  | Ensures continuous operation by maintaining redundant Jenkins instances and agents. |
| **Business Continuity**         | Ensures uninterrupted CI/CD pipelines, even in the case of system failure. |

## Conclusion

Setting up Jenkins for high availability is essential for ensuring that your CI/CD pipelines remain operational and efficient even during system failures. With multiple Jenkins masters, distributed agents, shared storage, and load balancing, you can achieve a resilient Jenkins environment that supports scalable and reliable operations. By implementing these best practices and configuring disaster recovery, you can reduce the impact of downtime and keep your software delivery pipeline running smoothly.
