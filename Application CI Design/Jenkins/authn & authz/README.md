## Introduction

Authentication and Authorization are essential components of Jenkins security, ensuring secure access and proper role-based permissions for users.

---
## Authentication in Jenkins

### What is Authentication

Authentication in Jenkins verifies the identity of users, ensuring only authorized individuals can access the system.

### Why Authentication

Authentication is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.

---
## Authentication Methods in Jenkins
### Built-in Authentication

1. Default User Database
- Jenkins maintains its own database for user authentication.
- Admin can create, delete, or manage user accounts.
- Suitable for small teams or simple setups.

### External Authentication Methods
#### 1. LDAP

- Integrates Jenkins with enterprise LDAP servers (e.g., Active Directory).
- Ideal for organizations with centralized user management.
- Requires configuring server details like server, root DN, and authentication credentials in Jenkins.

#### 2. Single Sign-On (SSO)

- Enables SSO through identity providers like Okta, Google, or Azure AD.
- Configured using plugins like SAML 2.0 Plugin or OIDC Plugin.
- Enhances user convenience and security by managing authentication externally.

#### 3. OAuth

- Jenkins supports OAuth via plugins to integrate with providers like GitHub, GitLab, and Google.
- Simplifies authentication for teams already using these platforms.

#### 4. Unix User Accounts

- Jenkins can authenticate against local Unix user accounts on the Jenkins server.

#### 5. Other Methods

- Plugins like Kerberos Authentication or Active Directory Plugin provide additional options.
  
### Plugins for Authentication

- Active Directory Plugin: Integrates with Microsoft Active Directory.
- SAML Plugin: Supports SAML 2.0-based identity providers.
- GitHub Authentication Plugin: Allows GitHub accounts to authenticate users.
- Keycloak Plugin: Integrates Jenkins with Keycloak for OAuth and SAML authentication.

## Authorization in Jenkins

### What is Authorization
Authorization controls what actions authenticated users can perform within Jenkins, based on their roles and permissions.

## Why Authorization
Authorization ensures users can only perform actions within their allowed scope, maintaining security and adhering to the principle of least privilege.

### Authorization Strategies

#### 1. Matrix-based Security

- Fine-grained control over permissions for individual users or groups.
- Permissions like Job Read, Build, Administer, etc., can be assigned to users/groups.

#### 2. Role-based Authorization Strategy

- Assign roles to users/groups with specific permissions.
- Global roles, project roles, and agent roles are defined for managing access.
- Requires installing the Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin.

#### 3. Project-based Matrix Authorization

- Similar to Matrix-based Security but scoped to individual projects.
- Useful for managing large teams with varying project permissions.

#### 4. Logged-in Users Can Do Anything

- Grants full access to all logged-in users.
- Suitable for small teams with high trust levels.

#### 5. Anyone Can Do Anything

- No restrictions on access.
- NOT recommended for production environments.

#### 6. Custom Authorization Plugins

- Plugins like Authorize Project Plugin or GitLab Commit Status Plugin allow further customization of permissions based on specific conditions.

## Securing Jenkins with Authentication & Authorization

| Topic	|Details|
|-----|-----|
|Enable Security|	 Navigate to Manage Jenkins â†’ Configure Global Security.|
|| Enable security and select appropriate authentication and authorization strategies.|
|Use External Providers|	 Use external providers for authentication to minimize local credential storage.|
|| Enforce stronger password policies and 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication).|
|Role-based Authorization	| Define clear roles and responsibilities to prevent unauthorized actions.|
|| Limit Administer permissions to a minimal set of users.|
|Audit Logs	| Regularly review Jenkins audit logs for suspicious activity.|
|| Use plugins like Audit Trail Plugin for enhanced logging.|
|Use Tokens for API Access	| Avoid hardcoding passwords in scripts.|
|| Use personal access tokens or API tokens instead.|

## Conclusion

Jenkins supports various authentication and authorization methods, including external options like LDAP, SSO, or OAuth. In our project, we use Built-in Authentication for user management and Role-based Authorization Strategy for assigning permissions based on responsibilities. Regular audits will ensure secure and efficient access control, aligning with our team size, infrastructure, and security needs.
