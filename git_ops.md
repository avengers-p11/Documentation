Introduction 
THis documentation explain how to implement Terraform GitOps effectively, including best practices, integration strategies with version control systems, and setting up automation pipelines for managing infrastructure lifecycle through GitOps.

What is Gitops 
Terraform GitOps is a combination of Terraform and GitOps, which are tools used to manage infrastructure as code. Terraform is an open-source tool that uses code to create, change, and manage cloud infrastructure. GitOps is a methodology that uses Git to manage infrastructure and operations
GitOps is a new way to manage infrastructure that focuses on automation, teamwork, and continuous delivery. The main idea is to use Git as the central place for storing all configuration and code. In GitOps, any changes to the infrastructure are made through pull requests, which other team members review and approve before merging into the main branch.
