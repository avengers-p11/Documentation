| **Disk I/O Rate**             | Measures the speed of read and write operations on the disk, indicating potential disk performance bottlenecks. |
| **Server Load**               | Tracks the number of processes waiting to be executed, helping to evaluate the serverâ€™s processing load. |
| **Uptime**                    | Measures the total time the server has been continuously running, important for reliability and availability. |
| **Temperature**               | Monitors the physical temperature of server components, critical for preventing hardware damage from overheating. |
