## Introduction
 

**Authorization (Authz)** refers to the process of determining what actions an authenticated user is allowed to perform within a Version Control System (VCS). Unlike **authentication (Authn)**, which verifies a user's identity, **authorization** ensures that users only have access to resources they are permitted to interact with.

In the context of VCS, proper authorization mechanisms are essential to safeguard code repositories, configurations, and other sensitive data from unauthorized access. By implementing robust authorization strategies, organizations can enforce security policies, maintain compliance, and promote collaboration in a controlled and secure environment.



## Why We Use Authorization

Authorization is crucial for the following reasons:

| **Reason**                                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Control Access to Sensitive Resources**  | VCS systems contain critical data such as source code, documentation, and configurations. Unauthorized access to these resources can lead to security breaches, code tampering, or intellectual property theft. |
| **2. Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege** | By limiting access to only the necessary resources, authorization ensures users have the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks, reducing potential security risks. |
| **3. Provide Accountability and Compliance**  | Properly implemented authorization mechanisms allow organizations to monitor user access and actions, ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations such as GDPR, SOC 2, or HIPAA. |
| **4. Enhance Collaboration**                  | Authorization ensures that only authorized team members can contribute to repositories or access sensitive resources, facilitating safe collaboration without compromising security. |
| **5. Prevent Conflicts and Mistakes**         | Restricting access to certain actions (such as merging or deleting repositories) helps reduce the risk of errors, conflicts, or malicious activity. |

## Integration with Identity Providers

Integrating your VCS with an **Identity Provider (IdP)** is essential for managing authentication and authorization efficiently. Integration with enterprise-level IdPs ensures consistent user management, centralizes access control, and supports compliance with organizational security policies.

## Types of IdP Integration

| **Integration Type**                | **Description**                                                                                                                     | **Benefits**                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Single Sign-On (SSO)**            | Enables users to log into the VCS system using corporate credentials via SSO (e.g., Active Directory, Google Workspace, Okta).       | Simplifies user login, centralizes authentication, and reduces password fatigue.                |
| **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect**      | Enables secure and modern token-based authentication for VCS systems and external IdPs.                                            | Popular with services like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket for enterprise-level authentication.    |
| **Active Directory / LDAP Integration** | Connect VCS systems to enterprise directories like Active Directory (AD) or LDAP to manage user roles and permissions centrally.    | Ensures seamless user provisioning and access control, particularly in large organizations.      |
| **Group-Based Permissions**         | VCS systems can map IdP groups to roles within the system. For example, users in the "Developers" group could automatically be granted Contributor access. | Automates user role assignment based on group membership, streamlining access control.            |


## Conclusion

**Authorization** is a cornerstone of securing VCS environments, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive resources and perform specific actions. By implementing a robust authorization strategy .
