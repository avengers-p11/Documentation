## Introduction

GitOps is a modern approach to managing infrastructure and applications using Git as the single source of truth, combining version control, collaboration, and CI/CD to enable automated, reliable, and auditable workflows for faster, more secure software delivery.

## Why GitOps

|Aspect	| Details |
|----------|------------|
| Auditability  | Git tracks all changes, providing a clear history for debugging and compliance. |
| Automation	| Reduces human errors by automating deployment and configuration processes. |
| Consistency	| Ensures infrastructure always matches the desired state defined in the Git repository. |
| Collaboration	| Simplifies collaboration by using Git workflows that developers are already familiar with. | 
| Scalability	| Handles large and complex systems effortlessly, enabling reliable scaling. |

## GitOps Principles

| Principle	| Explanation |
|-------------|--------|
| Declarative Configuration |	System state is defined using declarative manifests stored in Git. |
| Git as a Single Source of Truth | 	Git stores all configurations, enabling version control and rollback capabilities. | 
| Automated Reconciliation |	Automation tools ensure the actual state matches the desired state by continuously reconciling changes. | 
| Pull-based Deployment | 	Deployments are triggered through pull requests, ensuring thorough review and security. |
