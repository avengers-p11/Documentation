## Introduction

GitOps is a modern approach to managing infrastructure and applications using Git as the single source of truth, combining version control, collaboration, and CI/CD to enable automated, reliable, and auditable workflows for faster, more secure software delivery.

## Why GitOps

|Aspect	| Details |
|----------|------------|
| Auditability  | Git tracks all changes, providing a clear history for debugging and compliance. |
| Automation	| Reduces human errors by automating deployment and configuration processes. |
| Consistency	| Ensures infrastructure always matches the desired state defined in the Git repository. |
| Collaboration	| Simplifies collaboration by using Git workflows that developers are already familiar with. | 
| Scalability	| Handles large and complex systems effortlessly, enabling reliable scaling. |

## GitOps Principles

| Principle	| Explanation |
|-------------|--------|
| Declarative Configuration |	System state is defined using declarative manifests stored in Git. |
| Git as a Single Source of Truth | 	Git stores all configurations, enabling version control and rollback capabilities. | 
| Automated Reconciliation |	Automation tools ensure the actual state matches the desired state by continuously reconciling changes. | 
| Pull-based Deployment | 	Deployments are triggered through pull requests, ensuring thorough review and security. |

## GitOps Tools

| Tool |	Description|
|----|------|
| ArgoCD	| Kubernetes-native GitOps tool with a user-friendly GUI. |
|Flux	| Lightweight, CLI-based GitOps operator for Kubernetes.|
|Jenkins X | 	CI/CD tool that integrates GitOps principles with Kubernetes. |
|Rancher Fleet	| Multi-cluster Kubernetes GitOps solution. |
|Spinnaker |	Multi-cloud continuous delivery platform, supporting GitOps workflows. |

## GitOps Workflows and Procedures

|Step	| Description| 
|-----|-----|
|Set Up Repositories	|Create Git repositories for application and infrastructure configurations.|
|Define Desired State|	Write declarative files (e.g., YAML) describing the desired system and application state.|
|Commit and Push Changes|	Push configuration updates to the Git repository.|
|Automated Deployment	|CI/CD pipelines or GitOps tools apply changes to the environment.|
|Monitor and Reconcile	|Continuously ensure the live environment matches the Git repository state, reconciling any drift.|

## Benefits of GitOps

|Benefit	|Details|
|---------|--------|
|Consistency	|Prevents configuration drift across environments.|
|Speed	|Enables faster deployments, updates, and rollbacks.|
|Transparency	|Provides a clear audit trail of all changes through Git.|
|Security|	Gitâ€™s access control and review processes enhance operational security.|
|Scalability	|Efficiently manages multi-cluster or complex system environments.|

## Drawbacks of GitOps

|Drawback|	Details|
|------|-------|
|Learning Curve	|Requires knowledge of Git, declarative syntax, and GitOps tools.|
|Tool Complexity	|Managing multiple GitOps tools can be overwhelming.|
|Environment Limitations	|Challenging to implement in legacy or non-cloud-native environments.|
|Resource Overhead	|Continuous reconciliation loops may increase resource usage in large-scale deployments.|

## GitOps Best Practices

|Best Practice|	Details|
|--------|--------|
|Use Branching Models	|Adopt Git workflows like GitFlow or trunk-based development for better collaboration.|
|Encrypt Secrets	|Use tools like Sealed Secrets to secure sensitive data.|
|Automate Testing	|Validate changes through automated CI pipelines before deployment.|
|Monitor and Analyze	|Implement monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for insights and issue detection.|
|Maintain Documentation	|Document GitOps processes and configurations to ensure ease of use and onboarding.|

## FAQs

|Question	|Answer|
|----|--------|
|Can GitOps work outside Kubernetes?	|Yes, GitOps can be applied to any system supporting declarative configurations and automation.|
|How is GitOps different from DevOps?	|GitOps focuses on Git as the source of truth, while DevOps encompasses a broader set of practices and tools.|
|What happens if manual changes occur?	|Continuous reconciliation tools detect and fix drift, restoring the desired state defined in Git.|
|Is GitOps secure?	|Yes, Git provides controlled access, review mechanisms, and a clear audit trail for all changes.|

## Scenario

### Without GitOps

Manual processes lead to less consistency, more errors, and harder traceability. Changes require direct intervention.

### With GitOps

Declarative and automated workflows ensure consistency, reduce errors, and provide traceability and faster rollbacks, making deployments more reliable and scalable.
